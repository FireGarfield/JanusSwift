# JanusSwift

A Swift wrapper around [Janus RESTful API](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/rest.html).

# Installing

The package is available to be installed through SwiftPackageManager only.

# Available Plugins

Currently the only supported plugin is streaming and not all of the routes are there yet.

# Example App

There is an example on how to integrate Janus streaming plugin with WebRTC using SwiftUI. It's using RTCMTLVideoView only for now which means it won't work on iOS simulators.
